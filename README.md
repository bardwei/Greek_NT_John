# The Gospel According to John in Greek (Westcott and Hort), English (King James Version) and Spanish (RVR 1858)

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate the knowledge that I have learned in my CSC-270 class at Furman University titled "Digital Approaches to the Humanities." This GitHub repo provides an analysis and breakdown (via n-grams)* of the New Testament book "The Gospel according to John." By pulling this file the user will receive.

  - a .cex file with machine actionable citation (CtsUrn)** format for the Gospel according to John in Greek, English, and Spanish.

  - a separate .cex file to analyze the three texts.

  - an html writer script in the Scala programing language***.

  - a series of images for the html file

  - an attic folder for all the old scripts that I have run for the purpose of this class.
